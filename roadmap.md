for now just focus on getting everything working.
make all the components and iteratable objects

we won't have an info panel box like our roguelike. instead, we'll have an info box component that appears right next to the button you hover

also need a dialogue-like component thing

then we need to create some new systems to fill up the menu bar 

battle interface:
instead of a left to right battle, we can do top down instead (at least with how our current design is, that makes more sense). so enemy can be displayed at top and our own units and actions can be at bottom or something?


scenario:
you develop your town.

maybe some mysterious guy comes and offers to take you to a different area?
he will insist and if you decline, will just hang around.
(seems like he really wants your piece of land)

somehow sneak in some small flavor text of you getting scammed 
(like he sold off the land for 10k gold pieces but only gave you 10. okay maybe we can just add it a few days after u enter town, like "you overhear some people talking about how a man sold off a piece of land for 10k gold. surely that couldn't be the land that I received 10 gold for right?")
