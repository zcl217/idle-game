Some fortune teller that my wife wouldn't stop singing praises about told me that keeping a journal from now on will play a huge role in... what was it again.. I can't remember. Not sure how the life of a simple beastman such as myself will have an impact on anything, but hey, gotta keep the wife happy right? Since this journal seems to be so important, I guess I should try to write as much as possible.

<p> Year XXX Day 1 </p>

The sky was nice and blue.
The birds chirped and the air was fresh.
Today was yet another beautiful day as always.

Breakfast was just alright though.

I set up my stall in the town market a bit earlier than usual. These days, I'm especially motivated to earn money so I can support my son as much as possible. He's been studying for three years now to take some exam (the name of which sounded so complicated I forgot it within a few seconds) to become a high scholar of the capital's cathedral.

I'm not sure if I've heard of any beastmen working in the cathedral before, but if this is the path my son chose, I will do my absolute best to support him. 

The guy in the neighboring stall, Heff, commented yet again how it's so amazing for humans and beastmen to live in the same city in peace. It is nice indeed.

Dinner today was amazing as usual. Not because the food was good, but because this is the only time of the day I can see my son's face since he's always studying. I'm lucky to have such a hard working kid.

Yeah, I don't think I've written this much since the time I was learning to read and write in the tribe so I'm just going to make it short from now on. It's not like my wife or the sketchy fortune teller guy will check my journal anyway.

<p> Year XXX Day 3 </p>

My son passed the exam today! He says the exam has a pass rate of 1%, and that he only passed because he studied way more than the average human. Well, whatever the case, I told the wife to prepare an extra huge feast tonight in celebration.

Come to think of it, I don't think I've taken a day off since my son started studying. I guess I can finally take it easy now! I'm getting excited just thinking about the good times to come!

<p> Year XXX Day 5 </p>

I've been drinking with the bros almost daily now. Ever since my son passed his exam, my days have been filled with nothing but happiness. Well, I was already pretty happy, but I'm even happier now!

Anyway, the gossip that goes around in the tavern is as amazing as always. Recently, I've been hearing about the legendary heroes of the cathedral. All but two of them seemed to be former elite soldiers of the cathedral. Of the remaining two, I believe one was named Lutarez and the other Aedus.

<p> Year XXX Day 6 </p>

In a week, my son will finally be entering the cathedral to begin his training as a high scholar. Our entire family will be gathering up in our best attire to see him off in the town square.

<p> Year XXX Day 7 </p>

I heard some interesting news from Heff today. Apparently, an unprecendeted number of three beastmen passed this year's exams, so the grand scholar of the cathedral himself requested all beastmen to gather in the town square for a grand celebration. Amazing!

<p> Year XXX Day 9 </p>

The legendary hero Aedus was racing with the dragonknights of the cathedral in the high skies today. I can't believe a magician can be so powerful! I heard a ton of soldiers filled the streets to watch the race. Unfortunately, I couldn't witness this myself, but I'm sure it was a sight to behold.

Actually, today was pretty cloudy so I'm not sure how anyone saw it.

Some gossip I heard at the tavern claimed that it wasn't a friendly race, but a serious chase instead. People are creative as always.

Anyway, I need to rest well tonight so I have energy to drink all day tomorrow.

<p> Year XXX Day 10 </p>

The authorities wanted to limit the town square event to beastmen only, so everyone had to get a special identification badge at the cathedral today to make sure they're able to attend the event. I better make sure I keep this badge safe.

<p> Year XXX Day 12 </p>

My son and the other two beastmen had to enter the cathedral a day early than scheduled, so today was our last day together. It would've been nice for them to enter the cathedral as all the beastmen watched together from the town square during tomorrow's celebration event, but I guess this is nice in its own way.

I was originally planning on holding back the drinks tonight so I don't oversleep, but I guess it's okay for me to drink to my hearts content tonight!

<p> Year XXX Day ? </p>

How far am I from the capital now? Every time I tell myself that the next city will be different, I'm brought back to reality again.

<p> Year XXX Day ? </p>

If it weren't for the fact that I have some of my tribesmen with me right now, I would've lost my sanity long ago.

The day of the festival ended up as a nightmare. All the beastmen gathered in the town square were massacred. Heff helped me escape from the capital.

I need to live on. I need to see my son again. He wasn't in the town square that day. I'm sure he's safe.

<p> Year ? Day ? </p>

We've been branded as "demons" by the humans. Still haven't figured out their motives.
